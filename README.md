# dotfiles
A subset of my Ubuntu dotfiles for sharing

I'm experimenting with git-subrepo to publish part of my dotfiles
to github for sharing with others.

I deploy them with the included Makefile using the gnu stow command.

These settings allow seamless motion between Vim splits and tmux panes,
copy/paste that always uses the system clipboard, and mouse integration
that works identically at work on X11 or at home on my Chromebook using Secure Shell.
